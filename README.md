helmet detection using ml algorithms

In this project we have built CNN model to detect HELMETS and number plates from 25 different images and we can detect more images but we donâ€™t have sufficient dataset to train CNN model so our application can detect presence of helmet from 25 different images and if helmet not present then it will identify number plate and if helmet detected then it will not identify number plate.
